## My process

Had some challanges along the way,mainly positioning, but had a lot of fun too.
Should always PLAN on paper for example, the layout first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
  -JavaScript

### What I learned

Starting to get a bit faster and better with grid. Will try to refacture more and impement DRY code

### Continued development

Will try my next project using only mainly FLEXBOX, to understand it a lot better.

### Useful resources
